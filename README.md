# q-optimization-best-practices
A collection of guidelines to run quantum optimization algorithms on superconducting qubits using Qiskit.

## Quick Start

1. run `git clone https://github.com/ElePT/q-optimization-best-practices.git` in your local environment
2. do `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. do `pip install .`
4. navigate to the `how-tos` section and run the notebook of your choice!


## Table of Contents

The contents of the `qopt_best_practices` package are structured around the key strategies that 
can be applied to best run quantum optimization algorithms on real hardware:

1. Qubit Selection -> `qubit_selection`
2. SAT Mapping -> `sat_mapping`
3. Application of SWAP strategies -> `swap_strategies`
