# q-optimization-best-practices
A collection of guidelines to run quantum optimization algorithms on superconducting qubits.

## Warnings!
- This is a WIP repository at a very early stage.
  
- The current structure is not all definitive, 
expect directories will be added/renamed/moved around.

- The current code is tested in `tmp.ipynb` 
(top level directory) as a temporary measure until the layout
of the repository is decided. Proper unit tests will follow.
